In my first graphic I am analyzing data from the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) for both irrigated and non irrigated corn production in the state of Kansas, measured in bushels per acre. I put the two graphics besides each other in the line grid chart so the inconsistiency of non-irrigated corn production could be shown, and by extension non-irrigated farms higher susceptibility to drought. 

I used year for the x axis and bushels for acre for my y axis so the graph wasn more spread out and I could see the production value trends easier. 

In my second graphic I am analyzing drought data for the state of Kansas since 2000 until 2018, created by the United States drought monitor. According to the United States Drought Monitor website there are multiple methods they use to define and describe "drought data", which is done through the Drought Severity and Coverage Index, or DSCI. 

"You can compute it in two different ways: 1. Using computative Drought Monitor data, add the percentages for D0 through D4 to get the drought severity and coverage index for that week.
Or 2. To see more math, use categorical (not cumulative) Drought Monitor Data, and compute a weighted sum of the percentages in D0 through D4". 

I wanted both my graphics to show how climate change is hurting the agriculture industry, as you can see the increasing droughts along with slowed production (production is still growing over the past 25 years but is not keeping up with demand) and to also show how easy the affects of drought can be overlooked in the agriculture industry. 

Methodology

Datasets Used

The United States Department of Agriculture is a government agency responsible for overseeing and implementing various policies related to agriculture and forestry. This agency helps farmers and promotes food safety similar to the FDA, while also trying to promote agricultural trade between nations. The USDA has several divisions, including the food safety and inspection (FSIS), food assistance and nutrition, rural development and more.
The United States Drought Monitor collects drought information throughout the country to see how it affects farmers and the government alike. 

Limitations of data used for this story

When I was analyzing my drought data I had realized some years were not accounted for, but more than enough data was available so it didnâ€™t take away from the trend I was seeing in the data.
I reached out to 3 three potential interviewees 2 months ago, but Daniel came thankfully and he definitely helped me add an interesting angle to my story. 


AI Disclosure

AI, Artificial Intelligence, was used in this story to help with one or two lines of code in my final R project notebook. All other coding, analysis and information was completed by a human and used regular reporting methods. My outside source was not put into any AI editing software.
