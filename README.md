In my first graphic I am analyzing data from the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) for both irrigated and non irrigated corn production in the state of Kansas, measured in bushels per acre. I put the two graphics besides each other in the line grid chart so the inconsistiency of non-irrigated corn production could be shown, and by extension non-irrigated farms higher susceptibility to drought. 

I used year for the x axis and bushels for acre for my y axis so the graph wasn more spread out and I could see the production value trends easier. 

In my second graphic I am analyzing drought data for the state of Kansas since 2000 until 2018, created by the United States drought monitor. According to the United States Drought Monitor website there are multiple methods they use to define and describe "drought data", which is done through the Drought Severity and Coverage Index, or DSCI. 

"You can compute it in two different ways: 1. Using computative Drought Monitor data, add the percentages for D0 through D4 to get the drought severity and coverage index for that week.
Or 2. To see more math, use categorical (not cumulative) Drought Monitor Data, and compute a weighted sum of the percentages in D0 through D4". 

I wanted both my graphics to show how climate change is hurting the agriculture industry, as you can see the increasing droughts along with slowed production (production is still growing over the past 25 years but is not keeping up with demand) and to also show how easy the affects of drought can be overlooked in the agriculture industry.
