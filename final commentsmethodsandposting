Data has been collected on the crop value in the state of Kansas, dating back to 1866 as the original unedited dataset. 
The focus of my dataset is the change in this crop value over the last 30 years. This crop data was downloaded from the USDA Statistics Department.
This is the link where the data was accessed: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/

To get the crop data I needed off this link, I applied the following commodities to my data: 
- Program: Survey
- Sector: Crops
- Group: Field Crops
- Commodity: Corn
- Category: Yield
- Data Item: Corn, Grain - Yield, Measured in BU/Acre
- Geographic Level: State, State: Kansas

From there, I did the following code in an R notebook below :

- Downloaded dplyr, lubridate and stringr packages along with importing USDA data
- Selected Period and Value, and filtered for YEAR within that Period Column, getting rid of useless columns

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
finaldf1 <- read.csv('data/233B6EA2-8FBE-3F2C-99A1-F4CF354FD67F.csv', header=TRUE)
```
```{r}
finaldf2 <- finaldf1 %>%
select('Period','Value')
```
```{r}
finaldf2 <- finaldf1 %>% 
filter(Period=='YEAR')
```
With 'Period' and 'Value' both being selected I now plotted them on a graph, as seen below: 

```{r finaldf2_plot}
plot(finaldf2$Year, finaldf2$Value)
```

```{r}
finaldf3 <- read.csv('data/234EE2BB-6CD0-3B1C-ACC9-0025E3AAAAF7.csv', header=TRUE)
```

In this next part of my notebook, I decided to further analyze my data. One of the big reasons crops produce under quarter expectations is
weather a farmer has proper irrigation systems installed to aid his crops in times of drought. These systems hold water to keep crops 
fertilized and help stimulate crop growth. Below is code I used to look at irrigated versus non-irrigated crop production for the state of
Kansas to look the difference irrigation can make in crop production. Data was downloaded from the same website, with those two filters
applied to each of them, creating two different graphs. First, my imports and code for the Irrigated graph.

```{r}
finaldf3 <- read.csv('data/234EE2BB-6CD0-3B1C-ACC9-0025E3AAAAF7.csv', header=TRUE)
```

I started below by creating a new dataframe with the filter of the irrigation data. From there I did two mutations, the first of which I
created a new Value column (Value2), without the commas. In the next mutation I used it to clean my data by converting it from a string to
a numeric data type. 
```{r}
finaldf4 <- finaldf3 %>% 
filter(Data.Item=='CORN, GRAIN, IRRIGATED - PRODUCTION, MEASURED IN BU') %>%
mutate(Value2 = str_remove_all(Value, ',')) %>%
mutate(Value2 = as.numeric(Value2))
```

```{r}
finaldf5 <- finaldf4 %>% 
filter(Period=='YEAR')
```

This code chunk below created my Irrigated graph. 
```{r finaldf5_plot}
plot(finaldf5$Year, finaldf5$Value2)
title('Irrigated')
```

Secondly, my code and needed imports below for my Non-Irrigated crop production.
```{r}
finaldf6 <- finaldf3 %>% 
filter(Data.Item==unique(finaldf3$Data.Item)[2]) %>%
mutate(Value2 = str_remove_all(Value, ',')) %>%
mutate(Value2 = as.numeric(Value2))
```

```{r}
finaldf7 <- finaldf6 %>% 
filter(Period=='YEAR')
```
This code chunk below created my Non-Irrigated graph. 
```{r finaldf6_plot}
plot(finaldf7$Year, finaldf7$Value2)
title('Non-Irrigated')
```

In the last part of my notebook I decided to download drought data from the United States drought monitor, filtering for the state of 
Kansas from 2000-2018, the years in which I noticed production for both types of farms had some very low production rates. I found in my
data that non-irrigated farms are far more susceptible to drought than irrigated farms. Although that is common knowledge the raw data 
serves to amplify that statement. 

I downloaded the drought data from here: https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/DSCI.aspx

```{r}
df_droughtdata <- read.csv('data/dm_export_20000101_20181231.csv', header=TRUE)
```

```{r summary_noaa}
summary(df_droughtdata)
```
```{r date_column}
df_droughtdata2 <- df_droughtdata %>%
  mutate(MapDate2=as.character(MapDate)) %>%
mutate(MapDate3 = as.Date(x = MapDate2, format = "%Y%m%d"))
```
```{r summary_noaa_2}
summary(df_droughtdata2)
```
```{r add_year_column}
df_droughtdata3 <- df_droughtdata2 |>
  mutate(YEAR = year(MapDate3))
```
```{r groupbyyear_column}
df_droughtdata4 <- df_droughtdata3 |>
group_by(YEAR) |>
summarise(Average = mean(DSCI))
```
```{r plot_averagedsci}
plot(x = df_droughtdata4$YEAR, y = df_droughtdata4$Average, type = 'l')
title('Drought Average Data per Year')
```
```{r graphic}
write.csv(df_droughtdata4, 'Drought Average Data per Year.csv',row.names = FALSE)
```

In the code below I joined my irrigated and non irrigated data to be able to compare the data better side by side. 

```{r joined graphic}
joinedirrigated_nonirrigated<-full_join(finaldf5,finaldf7) %>%
  select(Year, Data.Item, Value2) %>%
  mutate(Data.Item2=case_when(Data.Item == 'CORN, GRAIN, IRRIGATED - PRODUCTION, MEASURED IN BU' ~ 'IRRIGATED',
                              Data.Item == 'CORN, GRAIN, NON-IRRIGATED - PRODUCTION, MEASURED IN BU' ~ 'NON-IRRIGATED'))
```
```{r joined graphic}
joinedirrigated_nonirrigated2<- joinedirrigated_nonirrigated %>%
select(-Data.Item)
```
```{r graphic}
write.csv(joinedirrigated_nonirrigated2, 'Irrigated_NonIrrigatedValue.csv',row.names = FALSE)
```
